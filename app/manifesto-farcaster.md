# Manifesto Farcaster — Soul Mint

This is a short manifesto describing the intent behind the `Mfer` mint.

- Purpose: to create a ritual NFT that celebrates small moments of alignment.
- Distribution: the mint is being tested on Base Sepolia (testnet) before mainnet.
- Interoperability: we aim to support Base Pay for fiat-denominated USDC payments and OnchainKit for wallet orchestration.
- Privacy: user addresses are not linked to off-chain personal data unless explicitly requested.

Next steps:
- Document the smart wallet onboarding flow (authorize smart wallet with contract if required).
- Add QA checklist for Farcaster + Base app tests.
